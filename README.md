# Python-Playlist-Youtube-Downloader
a small python scripts that allows downloading videos and playlists from command line


usage:  python downloader.py [mp3] [verbose]
example: python downloader.py True False 
          => will try to download in mp3 silently

[] args are optional, default are: mp3=True and verbose=False

mp3=True forces mp3 download if possible, otherwise it goes as mp4, which is what happens all the time, I think I probably messed up there
verbose=True shows how many bytes are left in the download, it's a mess though
